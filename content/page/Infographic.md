# Infographic: An Imaginary Aqua-Train

For this project we were asked to create a solution for a problem we experienced, involving time. Personally, I take a lot of public transport... During that time I always have my music or a book to make the time pass, but sometimes I forget them and then I'm just sitting there in my own imagination. Therefore, I chose to make my own fantasies come true. 

I present you the **Aquatrain**, a train where the windows are aquariums. Get out of your head, get off your phone, and get into an underwater world during your route.
