ABOUT ME

Hi, I’m Alison Kremer, a 20-year-old with a passion for life and personal growth. I grew up as the eldest of four children, bilingual in French and Dutch, in Schilde—a municipality near Antwerp, but never in the city itself. My childhood wasn’t perfect, but I’m grateful for it. My parents divorced when I was just two years old, so I never experienced a two-parent household. With a hardworking mom, I took on a lot of responsibility early in life. At just 20, I’ve already been through a lot—both good and bad—but I’m deeply thankful for these experiences as they’ve shaped me into who I am today.

MY PERSONALITY

I’d describe myself as an introverted extrovert. I’m deeply focused on personal growth, finding inner peace, achieving my goals, and balancing it all with a vibrant social life. Above all, my priority is to make myself proud rather than living to please others.

MY INTERESTS

I love spending time alone, whether it’s enjoying a coffee while reading a good book, journaling, or listening to music. At the same time, I cherish going out for a drink with friends or meeting new people.  

But my true passion—aside from graphic design—is **cooking.**\
Since my first student job at the age of 15, I’ve worked in the hospitality industry. I started in a local restaurant as a dishwasher and, within a month, became a sous-chef. By 17, I was running the kitchen as a chef, even without formal culinary training.  

MY DREAMS

I’m committed to giving 1000% to my future and becoming my higher self. My dreams include:  

-Teaching graphic design  
-Opening a food bar  
-Maybe writing a book someday   
-Pursuing a career in publicity  
-But above all becoming a mom one day  

I’m proud of who I am and everything I’ve accomplished so far. If you’re reading this, I hope it inspires you to reflect on yourself and to be proud of who you are too. Be proud of you.
