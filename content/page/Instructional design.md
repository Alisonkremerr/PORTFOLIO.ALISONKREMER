How can I explain strangers a new receipe without the use of words? This was the main question during this project. Personaly, I chose to combine analogue drawings with the ones I made in AdobeIllustrator and this is how it came out... 

Personally, I love to cook so this assignment was a lot of fun for me, it also was the first time that I worked with AdobeIllustrator to achieve such a nice storytelling. During this project I got in touch with a lot of new techniques and a new mindset "How do I communicate without the use of words? ". In conclusion: I really enjoyed the making off, and am still ver pleased with the outcome.
